// THE SPILL — wave survival authority.
//
// An acorn mining rig let go one system over. What reached us is a front of
// rock, cargo and shrapnel travelling one way: at you. No gates, no planets.
// Survive the wave; the next one is harder.
//
// This module is the RULES of the mode and nothing else — no canvas, no DOM,
// no art, no save. It is fed a dt and a handful of semantic inputs (hold,
// release, a burst, a lunge, a Depot purchase) and it answers with state and
// a list of cues for the frame. The sim mirrors its ship into the world so
// the shared draw path can paint it; draw.ts paints the field; standalone.ts
// builds the Depot sheet. That split is the same one Hyper Run made
// (race.ts), and for the same reason: everything in here can be driven from
// a node test with no browser at all.
//
// SECOND PASS (owner's flight notes, 2026-09-02). The first promotion kept
// the lab's squirrel and tap; this one flies the scout ship with the Hyper
// Run hand - hold to rise, release to fall, a swipe up or down for a burst -
// tuned to normal flight's response rather than the race's. FLIP is gone:
// gravity that inverts in a frame was the one rule that read as unfair. Its
// rung is DRIFT, a continuous tilt of the whole field, and every rule now
// phases in over three seconds with its name pinned beside the controls.
// A wave hands control back on a counted-down GO rather than whenever the
// card finished; the Depot docks for a second and holds its shelves inert
// for a moment, so a thumb still tapping cannot buy by accident. And the
// shelves are not rolled any more: the ship has four meters - PLATING,
// SHIELD, THRUSTERS, POWER-UPS - and a purchase fills one. PULSE is no
// longer a button the thumb has to find: unlocking it makes it fire on its
// own at the next impact, and charged coins are what charge it.
