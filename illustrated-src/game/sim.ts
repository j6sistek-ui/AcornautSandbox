/** THE FIRST FLIGHT, BEAT BY BEAT.
 *
 *  The lesson is in two halves and the split is the whole design.
 *
 *  In the SCRIPTED half the pilot's input is a GESTURE RECOGNISED, never a
 *  force applied. The indicator appears, the director waits - for as long as
 *  it takes, there is no window - and when the gesture arrives the director
 *  runs the beat on the game's own physics. A second tap does nothing.
 *
 *  That is what makes this teachable. Every previous version taught with
 *  live control: it armed a window, the pilot tapped, physics applied, and
 *  a beginner a beat early learned that the game does not respond rather
 *  than that they were early. There is no window here to miss.
 *
 *  In the LIVE half control is handed over for the first time, and the
 *  three gates that follow are the pass mark: they must be flown clean and
 *  CONSECUTIVELY. Protection means the pilot does not die, not that they
 *  advance - a contact rewinds to the first of the three. Without that a
 *  player could bump through every gate on protection and reach the portal
 *  having never actually flown one. The seven gates after the pal are
 *  ordinary practice: protected, forgiving, no rewind.

/** THE GESTURE RECOGNISER, and the reason the lesson is teachable.
 *
 *  While the tutorial is LOCKED a tap or a swipe is not a force. It is an
 *  answer to the beat on screen: the director checks whether it is the
 *  gesture being asked for, and if it is, runs the beat itself - on the
 *  game's own physics, so what the pilot sees is the real thing rather than
 *  an animation of it.
 *
 *  Two properties matter, and both were missing before:
 *
 *    * THERE IS NO WINDOW. The beat waits indefinitely. A pilot cannot be
 *      early, cannot be late, and never learns that the game ignores them.
 *    * A REPEAT DOES NOTHING. `want` is cleared the moment a gesture lands,
 *      so the second tap of an eager double-tap falls through to a beat
 *      that is no longer asking for anything.
 *
 *  Returns true when the gesture was consumed, which is the caller's signal
 *  to apply no physics of its own.

 *  satisfy both at that angle, the overflow is split evenly rather than
 *  spent entirely on one edge.
