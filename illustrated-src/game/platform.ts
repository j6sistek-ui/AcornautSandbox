/**
 * THE PLATFORM BRIDGE. Everything the game needs from the world outside
 * its own bundle goes through this one object: where the save is kept,
 * whether real money can be taken and at what price, where a score is
 * sent, and which doors are a shell's to open. The web build answers all
 * of it with localStorage and "not available"; a native shell (Capacitor
 * on iOS today, a Steam shell later) hands in an adapter on
 * `window.__acornautPlatform` BEFORE the bundle loads and the bridge
 * adopts it. Nothing in the game imports a store SDK, a Game Center SDK
 * or a Steamworks binding - the shell owns those, the game owns this
 * contract. See SHIPPING.md, "The platform bridge".
 *
 * This file imports nothing from the game, so catalog.ts and save.ts can
 * read it without a cycle.
